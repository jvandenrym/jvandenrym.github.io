Working in a Agile and SCRUM environment in a team of front-end and back-end developers. Build from scratch VO (Vlaamse overheid) themes which are configurable in a complete custom back-end Drupal solution. For more [information](http://kanooh.be/overzicht-functionaliteiten). Build the administration theme for the complete distribution which involved a lot of tweaking and customization of existing core and contributed modules.

##Go! Platform##

Our graphic studio first created a visual identity for the Go! School network websites. Build a Drupal 7 multi-site system that allowed for distinct theme for [each school](http://www.katervuren.be/) with a common base theme for each school. Drupal custom modules like school calendar, newsletters, photo album were all custom built. (Drupal theming - CSS - Jquery - ARIA)
