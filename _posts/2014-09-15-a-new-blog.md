Besides writing new articles I have included my guest blog posts I did in the past. These are a collection of interviews and book reviews which also appeared on the now defunct fadtastic - a web design journal from the UK.
For now I added the interview I did with Andy Budd about User experience which is still current and on-topic.

This blog was created by using web technologies like [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [Jquery](http://jquery.com/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). No background images where used to create the icons or logo. They are all <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>. It is a responsive theme created from scratch.
