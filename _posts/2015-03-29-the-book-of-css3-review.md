##What is it about?##
This book offers a good introduction to CSS 3 and will make you ready to start using CSS 3 in your future projects. All CSS 3 features get explained in length and in-depth with coding examples. This is a great asset of the book: thoroughly explained. The book goes through:

* Media queries and selectors (and pseudo selectors and -elements). The building blocks of your theme for your styles;
* Further chapters are about styling elements: typography, borders, boxes, colors, gradients, opacity, backgrounds;
* 2D and 3D transformations;
* How you can animate elements (animations, transitions);
* Columns, grid layouts (flex grids);
* Advanced stuff: blend modes, filters and masks.

And an overview of the browser support.

##Who is it for?##
Web designers, Front-end developers and Web developers in general that would like to get up to speed with CSS 3 and the many features it has to offer. It aims at both beginners, intermediate and advanced users.

##What did you think of the book?##
I think this book is a great book to learn more about CSS 3. Each chapter starts off with an introduction and delves into it. It not only explains how everyhting works (properties) but also what possible caveats are when you would use one or other feature. Both coding examples and concise illustrations of what the code produces in the front-end do a good job of explaining it all.
