title:  The meat of the burger icon
teaser: Is the hamburger any good as a responsive design pattern? It is a widely adopted UI design pattern that existed long before mobile and responsive even existed. The Xerox Star (1981) used a predecessor of the hamburger.

##Why hamburger icons?

The hamburger as a design pattern got re-introduced again when it was used in mobile apps and found its way to responsive web design.

Collapsing the navigation with the hamburger icon offers a way to manage the screen real estate where the available space is little on smaller viewports like on tablets and mobile phones.

On this [website](http://www.wbw.ch/) the hamburger is used by default on any screen size.

There will be users not familiar with the hamburger icon and will experience difficulties to navigate. This use case is often overlooked. Following this [study](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/killing-global-navigation-one-trend-avoid/) from the Nielsen Group it is not always a good idea to dismiss the top-level navigation and replace it with a hamburger.

##Navigation and UI
There have been UX studies that question the efficiency of the hamburger as a design pattern. It would not qualify sufficiently as a signifier in order to associate it with navigational elements. A [usability study from exisweb](http://exisweb.net/menu-eats-hamburger) was conducted to find out if people would prefer the burger icon or a textual 'MENU' link. A textual label 'MENU' would aid to clarify the meaning of the burger icon. This indicates that the icon does not stand on its own as a visual cue.

In any case [hiding navigation](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/04/08/ux-designers-side-drawer-navigation-costing-half-user-engagement/) it could confuse the end-user of what the site or application has to offer. There is always a trade-off to think about.

</div>
<div class="inline-image">
{% image modal_active.jpg "Example of a modal-like pattern" "Example of a modal-like  pattern (active state)" %}
</div>

In conclusion, often existing patterns are applied without evaluating first if it is the right design decision. Try to include user testing whenever possible.
