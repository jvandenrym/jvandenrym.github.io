        <title>The book of CSS 3 - a review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/cover-240.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Book of CSS3: A Developer’s Guide to the Future of Web Design, writ­ten by Peter Gasston&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Book of CSS3: A Developer’s Guide to the Future of Web Design, writ­ten by Peter Gasston&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is it about?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book offers a good introduction to CSS 3 and will make you ready to start using CSS 3 in your future projects. All CSS 3 features get explained in length and in-depth with coding examples. This is a great asset of the book: thoroughly explained. The book goes through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Media queries and selectors (and pseudo selectors and -elements). The building blocks of your theme for your styles;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further chapters are about styling elements: typography, borders, boxes, colors, gradients, opacity, backgrounds;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2D and 3D transformations;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you can animate elements (animations, transitions);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Columns, grid layouts (flex grids);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced stuff: blend modes, filters and masks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And an overview of the browser support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who is it for?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web designers, Front-end developers and Web developers in general that would like to get up to speed with CSS 3 and the many features it has to offer. It aims at both beginners, intermediate and advanced users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What did you think of the book?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this book is a great book to learn more about CSS 3. Each chapter starts off with an introduction and delves into it. It not only explains how everyhting works (properties) but also what possible caveats are when you would use one or other feature. Both coding examples and concise illustrations of what the code produces in the front-end do a good job of explaining it all.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The meat of the burger icon</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Why hamburger icons?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xerox Star (1981) used it for contextual menus already then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/xerox_big.png&quot; alt=&quot;Xerox Star burger icon&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Xerox Star burger icon&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hamburger as a design pattern got re-introduced again when it was used in mobile apps and found its way to responsive web design and web design in general. But is it any good?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could argue it&#39;s a possible solution to a design problem. Managing the screen real estate on the viewport of mobile devices especially smart phones and tablets in portrait mode. Navigation lists can be too wide to fit in the horizontal available space of the viewport. Add other elements like logo and search form and the available space is little on smaller viewport sizes like tablets and mobile phones. The navigation that would not fit otherwise is set to a hidden state. The hamburger icon controls the visible state of the navigation or other elements like secondary navigation, search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason would be to hide the navigation all together to focus on content first.  This could work if the end-user is still able to find its way. On this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wbw.ch/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; the entire menu is hidden under a burger icon on the desktop also on larger viewport sizes.
There must be links in that hidden navigation that are important enough to be visible instead of hidden. This question is often overlooked. Following this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nngroup.com/articles/killing-global-navigation-one-trend-avoid/&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from the Nielsen Group it is not a good idea to dismiss the top-level navigation and replace it with a hidden dropdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/burger_desktop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example of burger icon on desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Example of burger icon on desktop&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Navigation and UI&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been UX studies that question the efficiency of the burger icon as a design pattern. It would not qualify sufficiently as a signifier in order to associate it with navigational elements. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://exisweb.net/menu-eats-hamburger&quot;&gt;usability study from exisweb&lt;/a&gt; was conducted to find out if people would prefer the burger icon or a textual &#39;MENU&#39; link. A textual label &#39;MENU&#39; would aid to clarify the meaning of the burger icon. This indicates that the icon does not stand on its own as a visual cue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Further reading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peakusability.com.au/articles/mobile-ux-part-1-menu-burgers-and-navicons&quot;&gt;usability study on burger and navicons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/04/08/ux-designers-side-drawer-navigation-costing-half-user-engagement/&quot;&gt;hiding navigation&lt;/a&gt; behind a burger icon could prove detrimental to the end-user&#39;s perception of what the site or app has to offer. There is always a trade-off to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally the logo is always on the left but on many sites the burger icon appears both left and right on the top of the viewport. What is better left or right? It depends on the design and needs to be tested what works best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases it does work very well but it depends on whether the end-user is able to find and use the navigation accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the hamburger icon is used you don&#39;t see always state changes applied in the user interaction design. To provide a better user interaction adding a animated current state change proves very effective. As showcased here by using &lt;a href=&quot;http://sarasoueidan.com/blog/navicon-transformicons/&quot;&gt;CSS 3 transformations&lt;/a&gt; that indicate state change. This will help to make the end-user understand better the interaction performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;inline-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/modal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example of a modal-like pattern&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Example of a modal-like pattern&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;inline-image&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/modal_active.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example of a modal-like pattern&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Example of a modal-like  pattern (active state)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Rethinking the hamburger design pattern is always possible in the near future. The general idea is to test possible solutions on efficiency and have an open mind to improve when possible. Not every project is placed under the scrutiny of A/B testing. Often existing patterns are applied without evaluating first if it is the right design decision. Trends come and go, some are here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Andy Budd about user experience</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Who is Andy Budd?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy Budd is design and user experience lead at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clearleft.com/&quot;&gt;Clearleft&lt;/a&gt; and author of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://andybudd.com/&quot;&gt;Blogography&lt;/a&gt; weblog. This interview I conducted for Fadtastic back in 2006. Almost a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is the profession of web designer moving more towards interaction design that is graphic design + information design + human-computer interaction?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy: Most definitely. As the industry matures, website owners and users want more than just a pretty interface. Website owners want to differentiate their products and services from their competition by providing their customers with a better experience. Users want something that solves real problems in an enjoyable and easy to use way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The concept of user experience may be relatively new on the web, but we’ve seen this cycle many times before. Take consumer electronics. Early products are usually expensive and feature-poor. As the industry grows, the technology is the first thing to get refined and so companies start competing on looks instead of features. Once product lines start to become both fashionable and technically identical, the next logical step is to make them easier and more pleasurable to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does user experience stand usually for user-centric design or is it more?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy: User experience design is a difficult term to define as it actually relates to a whole series of disciplines, of which user-centered design is just one. With user-centered design you typically focus on the functional needs of the user to make a product or service that fits in with their life. User experience design pushes this concept slightly further, by not only creating something that is easy to use, but creating something that is actually a pleasure to use.
How can we provide quality of a user experience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best way to ensure a good experience is to research user needs; bring your creative problem solving skills to bare in order to design a solution; test that solution on real users, and then iterate based on their feedback. Good user experience design is an ongoing process rather than a one off commodity.
Is the access to information the key factor in interaction design?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy: Easy access to information is obviously a key factor in web usability which forms a huge part of interaction design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feedback of users is invaluable but how do you evaluate this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy: Very carefully. Users often try to be helpful and offer suggestions about why they thought a particular interaction was problematic or how it could be improved. However it turns out that people actually aren’t very good at evaluating their own actions and their reasoning can often be wildly off. As such it is much better to evaluate what users do rather than what they say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A last question: do you have an example of a website(-s) that provides a great user experience?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy: User experience is very personal, so what may provide a great experience for one set of users may provide a confusing experience to another group. Take Flickr. I personally love the user experience of this site–despite a few usability issues–but other people can find it confusing. Conversely there are millions of teenagers who think MySpace is the best thing in the world, despite the fact that it looks like the back end of a bus and is about as usable as a chocolate teapot.&lt;/p&gt;
